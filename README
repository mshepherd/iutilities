WHAT IS THIS MODULE FOR?
========================

This module overrides a few default behaviours:

* It re-orders some of the data when node-gallery galleries get displayed. It
  therefore depends on the node-gallery module.
* It inserts a message into the footer of the site, which cannot then be
  removed by a site admin.
